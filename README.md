Vending Machine JavaScript jQuery Application that uses a REST API 

Download and unzip. Click on your master file
If you have windows then click RUN.bat so it can run your VendingMachineRESTWebService.jar file. MAKE SURE WINDOWS COMMAND LINE IS OPEN 
AND RUNNING IF NOT YOU MIGHT WANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM SO IT STAYS UP AFTER CLICKING THE RUN.BAT. WHAT I DID WAS I RESTARTED MY COMPUTER.

If you don't have windows, google on how to run your .jar file.

After running the .jar file successfully make sure to download "allow control allow origin" extension to your browser. I used chrome.
Finally click on home.html and your file should run and API should be doing it's job.
